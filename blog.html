  <h1>Month 8, Day 1, Year 2022</h1>
  From Perl to PHP; PHP to Python, Ruby, and JS; JS to Clojure; Clojure to Elixir; Elixir to TypeScript. <br />
  There's Java, C, C# and a few others I had the pain and pleasure with, but it is TypeScript that somehow became my default. <br />
  It's worse than just about every language I've ever used, but it's successful because the brain to key translation is frictionless. <br />
  Haskell and Clojure are the best languages to exist in my opinion, but the fire and exuberance of Elixir community is second to none. <br />
  Elixir actually has types, but it's not compiler enforced, if you weren't aware. It's not the same, though. I've been coding untyped for <br />
  25 years and I feel that APL has the correct idea with the wrong set of keys. Maybe one day there will be a language that makes you think <br />
  Functional TypeScript but dances like Clojure. New languages could learn a lot from C. Part of the reason for the dependcy bloat is that <br />
  very few attempt to actually understand how to code things. Not that I'm the best, but I wouldn't improve if I downloaded 100 libs <br />
  to "Hello World". Since everyone seems to be some kind of extremist these days, I want to see a Godot library for FASM. Dare to dream.
